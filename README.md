# AI-Powered Medicaid Waiver Video Creation System

## Overview

This n8n workflow automates the creation, translation, and distribution of educational short-form videos about Medicaid waivers for individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD). The system addresses critical accessibility challenges by converting complex waiver information into plain-language, multilingual videos distributed across social media platforms.

## Problem Statement

Medicaid waiver programs like NOW/COMP in Georgia serve over 7,000 people on waiting lists, yet many families struggle with:
- Confusing eligibility rules written in dense policy language
- Complex application processes with high rejection rates
- Long waitlists with unclear priority systems
- Limited accessible information for non-English speakers
- Bureaucratic overload reducing efficiency

## Solution Architecture

The system leverages AI to create educational videos that:
- Convert verified waiver documents into plain-language scripts
- Generate videos in multiple languages with captions
- Automate distribution across TikTok, Instagram, YouTube Shorts, and Facebook
- Include human approval gates for accuracy and quality control
